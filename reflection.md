## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete this section without checking the solutions. I found the exercises to be a great introduciton to HTML.

### Accessibility

I was able to complete this section without checking the solutions. I think the one exercise was efficient
enough to cover accessibility.

### CSS

I had to check the solutions for a couple of exercises. I think the exercises for this section were very informative, I wish there was an exercise specifically about the box model.

### Flexbox

I had to follow along with the solutions to complete most of the exercises. The exercises covered the fundamentals of flexbox well.

### CSS Grid

I was able to complete this section without checking the solutions. Much like flexbox theses exercises covered the topic of CSS grid well. I wish there were exercises that compared the pros and cons of CSS grid vs flexbox.

### Bootstrap

I was able to complete this section without checking the solutions. This section was a great introduction to bootstrap although I wish there were more exercises highlighting other modules.

### Javascript

I was able to complete this section without checking the solutions. I think this section was great but contained a lot of material. I think it could have been split into two sections.
